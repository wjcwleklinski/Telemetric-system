Telemetric system is a system which gather various information from sensnsors and send them to head unit.
This project is a part of my engeneering degree project. First part assumed creation of microcontroller system which measures parameters of race car in real time and send them via Bluetooth to Android device. Second part was a visualization part. To visualize measurements simple Android application has been created. The measurments are displayed in text form and on charts.
This repository contains only Android Studio project.
Following application enables simple communication with external measurment system via Bluetooth.
